Learning to mine twitter on a topic: This project is 
included in the list, so that beginners can correlate to the power of data science. 
With help of twitter and a good data science tool, you can find out what the world is saying about a particular topic. 
I was mesmerized by this, when I did this for the first time. 
Be it reviews about movies, sentiments about elections or any hot topic off the press – you can know what the people are saying by yourself. 
Performing this exercise not only helps you understand some of the challenges in mining social media (especially, if you are interested in text 
mining), it also helps you understand how easy it is to integrate an API in your scripts to access the information available on social media.
